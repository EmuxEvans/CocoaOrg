  An simple example will explain everything.

  #+BEGIN_SRC swift
    import CocoaOrg

    let lines = [
        "* TODO head line",
        "  A normal line here.",
    ]
    let parser = OrgParser()
    let doc = try parser.parse(lines: lines)
  #+END_SRC
* Next Move [1/7]
  - [ ] Table
  - [X] Checkbox in list item
  - [ ] Priority
  - [ ] Tags
  - [ ] Footnote
  - [ ] Clock
  - [ ] Attachments

* TODO Performance Test

* Maybe? [0/2]
  - [ ] Latex Support
  - [ ] Macros

* Contribute
  CocoaOrg is written in Swift 3. So you need xcode 8 to be able to build it.
** Setup
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     ./bin/setup
     ./bin/test
